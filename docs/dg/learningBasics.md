Depending on what you have already known and what you would like to work on (backend or frontend), you may find certain sections irrelevant to you and you can skip them accordingly.
</box>

## Backend

<box type="info" seamless>

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the backend of RepoSense. You may skip this section if you want to contribute as a pure frontend developer. Before you get started, you should have set up the project on your computer according to [the _Setting up_ page](settingUp.html).
</box>

The backend implementation of RepoSense is located in `src/main`.

{{ step(1) }} Know Java

The RepoSense backend is mostly written in `Java 8`. 

1. You need to have a basic knowledge of Java before getting started, including its syntax, [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/), and certain frameworks such as [JUnit](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/java/JUnit.html).
1. Once you are familiar with the basic syntax, you may wish to learn more advanced topics such as [concurrency](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/java/JavaConcurrency.html), [synchronization](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/java/JavaSynchronization.html), and [streams](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/java/streams-an-introduction.html). These topics are optional but you may find them useful when working These topics can help you to understand certain part of the backend implementation (concurrent cloning and analysis of multiple repositories, etc). They are optional but you may find them useful when working on certain issues.

{{ step(2) }} Learn the RepoSense backend architecture

You may want to refer to the [backend architecture](architecture.html). This can greatly help you to understand the implementation logic.

To gain a more concrete idea of how the backend works, you can use the IDE Debugger to trace through the steps of how the JSON files are generated by running RepoSense under debugging mode.

<box type="warning" seamless>

The information below is for **Intellij**. If you are using a different IDE, you may need to check the documentation of how to use the debugger separately.
</box>

* Check the [debugging guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html) if you are not familiar with debugging in **Intelij**.
* In `RepoSense.java`, the main class, set appropriate break points. Here are some relevant method calls in the `main` method at which you can set the breakpoints: For example, you can set the first 3 breakpoints to be at ``  to inspect how CLI arguments, CSV files configuration, and JSON file configuration are retrieved, corresponding to the first step in the architecture diagram. The last break point is set at the `generateReposReport` method, where 
  * `ArgsParser.parse(args);`: RepoSense parses the CLI arguments from the command.
  * `getRepoConfigurations(cliArguments);`: RepoSense gets the configuration for each repository by parsing the CSV files.
  * `getReportConfigurations(cliArguments);`: RepoSense gets the report configuration (report title) by parsing the JSON files.
  * `ReportGenerator.generateReposReport(...);` This is where the bulk of the work is conducted, including cloning repositories, analyzing repositories, and generating the JSON files to be used by the report.

<box type="info" seamless>

When tracing through the program execution, you can cross reference the architecture diagram and Javadoc of the class and method to check your understanding of the procedure.
</box>

{{ step(3) }} Gain some hands-on experience

Here is a small task for you to get started on contributing to RepoSense backend. Select an issue and try to work on it according to the guidance given in the issue comment.

1. Open a [report](https://dashboard-1507-pr-reposense-reposense.surge.sh/).
2. You should see that there is a red panel in the summary view containing the following message, indicating that there is an issue in the cloning process of the repository `reposense/testrepo-Empty`.

```
reposense/testrepo-Empty[master]
        Failed to clone from https://github.com/reposense/testrepo-Empty.git
```

**Your task**

For the repository with the message `Failed to clone from ...`, find out what exception causes this cloning error, and add that exception message to the panel as well.

<panel header="Hint 1">

You can find out what [`ErrorSummary.java`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/src/main/java/reposense/report/ErrorSummary.java) and [`RepoCloner.java`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/src/main/java/reposense/report/RepoCloner.java) do, and where they are used.
</panel>

<panel header="Hint 2">

Try to understand the cloning process. The cloning process is invoked by [`RepoGenerator.java`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/src/main/java/reposense/report/ReportGenerator.java) in the `cloneAndAnalyzeRepos` method, which subsequently calls `cloneBare` in `RepoCloner.java` to start the cloning. The `cloneAndAnalyzeRepos` method will then call `getRepoLocation`  in `RepoCloner.java` to try to get the repository location. Beneath the surface, `RepoCloner` will first execute `spawnCloneProcess` and then execute `waitForCloneProcess` when it is invoked by `RepoGenerator` for the first and second time respectively.
</panel>

<panel header="Hint 3">

In `RepoCloner`, the potential exceptions in `spawnCloneProcess` and `waitForCloneProcess` are caught but not recorded by `ErrorSummary`. 
</panel>

<panel header="Suggested solution">
  There is more than 1 way to achieve this. One solution is shown as the following:
  
  Add this to the catch block of `spawnCloneProcess` and `waitForCloneProcess`.
  
  ``` 
  ErrorSummary.getInstance().addErrorMessage(config.getDisplayName(), e.getMessage());
  ```
</panel>

{{ step(4) }} Get familiar with the workflow

The next step is to learn how to enhance the code quality according to the coding standard, write necessary tests and documentation, verify that the changes passes the test cases, and submit the pull request. You can refer to [the _Workflow_ page](workflow.html).

{{ step(5) }} Get started with contributing

RepoSense currently has a lot of open issues, and some may be challenging. Now that you are ready, you can check the issues in the [roadmap for contributors](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/projects/2#column-13522966) to work on actual pull requests.

<box type="info" seamless>

Some issues, such as [#937](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/937), have linked pull requests from previous contributors. You can refer to these pull requests for implementation details.
</box>

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Frontend

<box type="info" seamless>

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the frontend of RepoSense. You may skip this section if you want to contribute as a pure backend developer.
</box>

The frontend implementation of RepoSense is located in `frontend/src`.

{{ step(1) }} Learn the necessary tools

It is necessary for you to learn the basics of Vue.js, Pug, and SCSS before working on the project. 

  {{ embed('Appendix: tools to learn for frontend development', 'tools.md', level=2) }}

{{ step(2) }} Learn the RepoSense frontend architecture

* You may want to refer to the [frontend architecture](report.html#report-architecture) to understand the implementation.
* Another way for you to understand the frontend is to use **Vue.js devtools** to learn how the various Vue Components interact with each other. You can refer to the [frontend debugging guide](workflow.html#debugging-front-end) for more information.

{{ step(3) }} Gain some hands-on experience

Here is a small task for you to get started on contributing to RepoSense frontend. Select an issue and try to work on it according to the guidance given in the issue comment.

1. Open a [report](https://dashboard-1507-pr-reposense-reposense.surge.sh/).
2. Randomly open the authorship contribution panel of an author (The icon is `</>`).
3. You should see that, after you open the panel, the author title background on the left panel becomes yellow, and the background of the `</>` icon you clicked becomes green.

**Your Task** 

Make corresponding changes to `summary charts` so that in step 3, after opening the panel, the font colour of the author title on the left panel also becomes green.

<panel header="Hint 1">

Try to locate where the author title is in [`summary_charts.pug`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/summary_charts.pug).
</panel>

<panel header="Hint 2">

You can check what `activeUser` and `activeRepo` do in [`v_summary_charts.js`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/static/js/v_summary_charts.js).
</panel>

<panel header="Hint 3">

Refer to how changes are made to the title background and icon background in [`summary_charts.pug`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/summary_charts.pug).
</panel>

<panel header="Hint 4">

Some of the CSS styling for `summart_charts.pug` is in [`v_summary.scss`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/static/css/v_summary.scss).
</panel>

<panel header="Suggested solution">
  There is more than 1 way to achieve this. One solution is shown as the following:
  
  Add this to `v_summary.scss`.
  
  ``` 
  .active-text {
    color: mui-color('red', '200');
  }
  ```

  In `summary_charts.pug`, locate `summary-chart__title--name`, and add the following to its `v-bind:class` attribute map.
  
  ```
  'active-text': user.name === activeUser && user.repoName === activeRepo
  ```
</panel>
