Depending on what you have already known and what you would like to work on (backend or frontend), you may find certain sections irrelevant to you and you can skip them accordingly.
</box>

## Backend

<box type="info" seamless>

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the backend of RepoSense. You may skip this section if you want to contribute as a pure frontend developer. Before you get started, you should have set up the project on your computer according to [the _Setting up_ page](settingUp.html).
</box>

The backend implementation of RepoSense is located in `src/main`.

{{ step(1) }} Meet the language requirement

The RepoSense backend is mostly written in `Java 8`.

1. If you are not familiar with Java, you can refer to the [Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) to learn the basic syntax, standard library, and its object oriented nature. There are also plenty of other resources available from YouTube and other sites, and feel free to search for the learning resources that are most suitable to you.
1. You may also find the [Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) quite helpful when you are unsure about the usage of a certain class or method in a Java program.
1. Once you are familiar with the general syntax, you may wish to learn more [advanced topics](https://se-education.org/learningresources/index.html) such as concurrency, synchronization, streams, and writing backend tests in order to work on issues that require the corresponding knowledge.  

{{ step(2) }} Learn the RepoSense backend architecture

You may want to refer to the [backend architecture](architecture.html). This can greatly help you to understand the implementation logic.

To gain a more concrete idea of how the backend works, you can use the IDE Debugger to trace through the steps of how the JSON files are generated by taking the following steps.

<box type="warning" seamless>

The steps are for **Intellij**. If you are using a different IDE, you may need to check the documentation of how to use the debugger separately.
</box>

1. Check the [debugging guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html) if you are not familiar with debugging in **Intelij**. In particular, learn how to use features such as `step into` and `step over` to trace the program execution.
1. In `RepoSense.java`, set appropriate break points. For example, you can set it according to the diagram above. The first 3 breakpoints are set to inspect how CLI arguments, CSV files configuration, and JSON file configuration are retrieved, corresponding to the first step in the architecture diagram. The last break point is set at the `generateReposReport` method, where the bulk of work is conducted, including cloning the repository, analyzing the repository, and generating the JSON files to be used by the report.
1. In `Edit Configurations` of **Intellij**, set the current task to be the Gradle task `RepoSense [run]`, and click the debugging button on the right to start debugging (Make sure that you import the project as a Gradle project first according to [the tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)).
1. Step into each break point when you think it is necessary to know more about the implementation, and step over otherwise to continue the execution.

When tracing through the program execution, you can cross reference the architecture diagram and Javadoc of the class and method to check your understanding of the procedure.

{{ step(3) }} Get started with contributing

Here are some small [tasks](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ad.FirstTimers+label%3Aa-Backend+is%3Aopen) for you to get started on contributing to RepoSense backend. Select an issue and try to work on it according to the guidance given in the issue comment.

<box type="info" seamless>

Some issues, such as [#937](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/937), have linked pull requests from previous contributors. You can refer to these pull requests for implementation details.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

If you want to try some more challenging tasks, you can check the issues in the [roadmap for contributors](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/projects/2#column-13522966).
</box>

{{ step(4) }} Get familiar with the workflow

The next step is to enhance the code quality according to the coding standard, write necessary tests and documentation, and verify that your changes passes the test cases. After that, you can submit the pull request. You can refer to [the _Workflow_ page](workflow.html).

## Frontend

<box type="info" seamless>

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the frontend of RepoSense. You may skip this section if you want to contribute as a pure backend developer.
</box>

The frontend implementation of RepoSense is located in `frontend/src`.

{{ step(1) }} Learn the necessary tools

It is necessary for you to learn the basics of `Vue.js`, `pug`, and `scss` before working on the project. 

  {{ embed('Appendix: tools to learn for frontend development', 'tools.md', level=2) }}

{{ step(2) }} Learn the RepoSense frontend architecture

* You may want to refer to the [frontend architecture](report.html#report-architecture) to understand the implementation.
* Another way for you to understand the frontend is to use **Vue.js devtools** to learn how the various Vue Components interact with each other. You can refer to the [frontend debugging guide](workflow.html#debugging-front-end) for more information.

{{ step(3) }} Get started with contributing

Here are some small [tasks](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aa-FrontEnd+label%3Ad.FirstTimers) for you to get started on contributing to RepoSense frontend. Select an issue and try to work on it according to the guidance given in the issue comment.
